# unit_conversion
We'd like to ask you to implement a simple library that converts lengths in different units. For example: ● 6 m to yard = 6.562 yd ● 2.5 yd to inch = 90 in The units to be supported are: metre (m), yard (yd) and inch (in). The design of the library should support adding new units easily. It should also support representing the measures as user-friendly strings (e.g., "2.3 m", "6 yd", "0.4 in").
