# Unit Conversion Challenge

We'd like to ask you to implement a simple library that converts lengths in different units. For example:

* 6 m to yard = 6.562 yd
* 2.5 yd to inch = 90 in

The units to be supported are: metre (m), yard (yd) and inch (in). The design of the library should support adding new units easily. It should also support representing the measures as user-friendly strings (e.g., "2.3 m", "6 yd", "0.4 in").

# Rules

This library should be implemented using:

* A high-level programming language, preferably the one you're the most familiar with.
* Test-Driven Development.
